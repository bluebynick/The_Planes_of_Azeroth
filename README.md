# The_Planes_of_Azeroth
This program is a pull back matrix which will launch a Symbol at a target from the MMORPG World of Warcraft. Players have the option to play as either the Alliance faction or the Horde faction, two warring groups in WoW. The symbol launched is affected by gravity and will trigger an explosion if it hits the target after only one wall bounce, otherwise it'll pass right over unharmed. There is 4 different sound tracks playing throughout the game and there is also many sound effects such as explosions. The symbol chosen as missle will bounces off all the walls and after 4 bounces it will no longer be contained within the screen and will fall out. After you hit the target 5 times there is a special surprise from one of the game's most loved characters, Lord Jaraxxus.
